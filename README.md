## Introduction

***

Welcome to **Lord of the Recipes**. This website has been built for my fourth portfolio project with the Code Institute to create a django based application. This site is a hosting platform for recipes with a pop culture theme. So the target audience is anyone with a passion for cooking or baking (or y'know, just food in general) and a love for pop culture of any flavour. The recipes are open to be viewed by anyone who stumbles across the site. To add their own recipes, save their favourites or leave comments on other recipes, users must register an account.  
Unfortunately the internet can be a dangerous place these days, so to protect users from trolls and other creatures which lurk in the dark recesses of the web any content uploaded will be submitted to admin for approval before being published. 

### Project Planning

#### Wireframes

<summary>Home Page - logged in view</summary>

A logged in registered user sees a logout and profile button in the navbar and footer instead of login and register. Clicking the burger button causes the navbar to expand/collapse. This is common across all pages. The signup box on the home page is removed.

#### UI design

**Fonts**
* The main font used is x because x
* The main heading font is x because x
* The recipe create form has summernote fields which gives users the ability to quickly input their own fonts, styles etc. As this site aims to deliver a community feel I felt it best to enable users to be able to express some personality.
