## Introduction

***

Welcome to **Lord of the Recipes**. This website has been built for my fourth portfolio project with the Code Institute to create a django based application. This site is a hosting platform for recipes with a pop culture theme. So the target audience is anyone with a passion for cooking or baking (or y'know, just food in general) and a love for pop culture of any flavour. The recipes are open to be viewed by anyone who stumbles across the site. To add their own recipes, save their favourites or leave comments on other recipes, users must register an account.  
Unfortunately the internet can be a dangerous place these days, so to protect users from trolls and other creatures which lurk in the dark recesses of the web any content uploaded will be submitted to admin for approval before being published. 

### Project Planning

#### Agile Development

Agile development helps to create an organised and efficient development plan to create a project which fulfills it's purpose. I have attempted to use this approach to build this project.  
This system requires a thorough project planning phase - deciding what the app is, and what the main goals of the project are. These are then developed into user stories, and features are built to address these user stories. To keep track of my development I created a user stories kanban board in github projects ([here](https://github.com/hartnetl/lord-of-the-recipes/projects/1)). I created an issue for each user story which was set to automatically display in my user story project. As I tackled each user story, it was moved to the in progress column. When I felt it had been completed it was moved to complete. Agile development also allows for the project to change. If the requirements have been met it is possible to revisit an issue to make changes or improvements to deliver the project in the best form possible.  
A second kanban board was created on github projects - a [todo list](https://github.com/hartnetl/lord-of-the-recipes/projects/2). This list contained small detail or general things that were needed but weren't attributable to a user story.


#### User Goals

As a user I want to be able to   

* Browse recipes
* Add my own recipes
* Save recipes for quick access
* Easily find required information through intuitive layout and filter options
* Explore a well laid out, easy to use site on any device 

As a site owner I want to be able to  

* Add recipes
* Moderate the content being uploaded by users to create a safe and welcoming space
* Create a website that can be easily used by all to increase number of users
* Create a community of like minded people
* Encourage users to register on the site as that makes them more likely to reuse the site
* Offer a usable, convenient website which people actually wish to use day after day


#### User stories 

| As a:       | I can:         | So that:  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| general user  | click on the navbar links | I can easily and intuitively go from one page to another |
| general user  | use the contact page form |  I can communicate with the admin of the page with questions, comments, user feedback etc |
| general user  | click recipes | I can view them fully on a new page |
| general user  | search recipes by tags | I can easily find what I'm looking for |
| general user  | view a list of recipes | I can choose which one to make |
| general user  | create an account | I can join the community and get access to registered user features like creating recipes and adding comments |
|  |     |  |
| Registered User |  upload recipes  |  recipes can be viewed by myself and others when complete, or saved as a draft for myself until ready to be published |
| Registered User |  create, edit and delete my recipes | I can control my own contributions to the site |
| Registered User | add comments on recipes  | I can be a part of the conversation with the community |
|  |       |   |
| Superuser | approve content (recipes and comments) | I can manage the content and filter out those with unsuitable language etc |  
| |     |  |

#### Wireframes

<details>

<details>
<summary>Home Page - logged in view</summary>

A logged in registered user sees a logout and profile button in the navbar and footer instead of login and register. Clicking the burger button causes the navbar to expand/collapse. This is common across all pages. The signup box on the home page is removed.

#### UI design

**Fonts**
* The logo font used is [bubblegum sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bubblegum+Sans). It's a very fun and quirky font suited to the vibe of the page.
* The main text font used is [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans?category=Sans+Serif). It is a sans-serif font which is more a more accessible font type, and I think it compliments my header font nicely.
* The main heading font is [Architects Daughter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Architects+Daughter). Is is a relaxed, easy to read font which adds a bit of playfulness to the headings.
* The recipe create form has summernote fields which gives users the ability to quickly input their own fonts, styles etc. As this site aims to deliver a community feel, I felt it best to enable users to be able to express some personality and creativity.

**Colour Scheme**

## Data Structure

The database used locally and by heroku is postgres.  
Cloudinary is used to house user images uploaded to the website.  

The database contains two custom models - recipes and comments. Both link to the user model which is built into django.
Each registered user is assigned a user id. They can create recipes which will be linked to their id, and each recipe has an auto generated slug field (this is derived from the recipe's title). The recipe can be edited and deleted by the person who created it only (or admin, if guidelines are breached). Registered users can leave comments on any recipe and the comment will display their username. A registered user can choose to publish recipes so they are displayed on the public recipe page, or leave them as drafts so they will only be visible on their own profile page.

## Testing 

***

### Manual Testing

The manual testing file is [here](TESTING.md)


### Validation

html: [W3C markup validator](https://validator.w3.org/)   
Each page url was ran through the validator and any errors or warnings that appeared were corrected, and the url was ran through the validator again.  
<details>
<summary>This is the error and warning free validation seen for most pages</summary>

![w3c html validator results for home page](static/readme/html-validated.png)
</details>
<details>
<summary>Extra closing p tag error</summary>

In some pages such as the profile page, recipe view page and recipe list page an error was showing that there was a closing p tag but no opening tag for it. In my hardcoded html there was no extra closing p tag. I believe this to have come from the use of summernote injecting it's own html. Feedback from previous projects were very specific about not leaving in **any** errors so I made the decision to follow the validator and remove the hardcoded closing p tag. This removes the error upon validation, and none arise for not having a closing tag hard coded.

![p tag error](static/readme/p-close-error.png)
</details>  
<br>

CSS: [W3C validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)  
CSS file was copied into the validator and all errors and warnings returned were addressed.  
<details>
<summary>View clear validator</summary>

![css validator with no warnings](static/readme/css-validate.png)
</details>   

<br>

Python: [pep8](http://pep8online.com/)  
Code was copied directly into the validator.
<details>
<summary>Pep8 all clear message</summary>

Most python files were vallidated and corrected to have no errors or warnings. 
![pep8 no warnings or errors visible on most python files](static/readme/pep8.png)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Some files had long lines which couldn't be broken</summary>

settings.py and views.py have lines which throw errors if broken using ' \ '.  
Instead #noqa was used to allow the validator to pass that line length error.  
While the limit should be kept below 79 characters, it is permissable to go up to 99 [[link](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#:~:text=Some%20teams%20strongly%20prefer%20a%20longer%20line%20length.%20For%20code%20maintained%20exclusively%20or%20primarily%20by%20a%20team%20that%20can%20reach%20agreement%20on%20this%20issue%2C%20it%20is%20okay%20to%20increase%20the%20line%20length%20limit%20up%20to%2099%20characters%2C%20provided%20that%20comments%20and%20docstrings%20are%20still%20wrapped%20at%2072%20characters.)]

## Deployment

***

This program is deployed using [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/login).  

Before deploying a project, ensure all dependencies (libraries etc that Heroku needs to build and run your project) are listed. The command "pip3 freeze > requirements.txt" in the python terminal will generate this list in a file called requirements.txt which will be read by Heroku.  
Ensure debug is set to false

### Set up the App


### Deployment

Note: These steps will walk through some of the steps to set up the environment settings just to ensure they are the same

This project was originally deployed following this Code Institute [cheat sheet](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fst/Django%20Blog%20Cheat%20Sheet%20v1.pdf)

* In your editor's terminal enter the following command:  

        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    This will install all the dependancies needed to run the project


### Connect to heroku

Set up app on heroku 

* Go to Heroku, and register/login
* Click 'create new app'
* Setup your app name and region
* Navigate to the Resources tab. Set your database to Postgres with the hobby dev option.
* Go to the Deploy tab and connect your Github repository by searching for it (this one is lord-of-the-recipes)

Connect postgres database to local environment

* Go to or create env.py and import os
* set up your database and secret key

        os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Paste in Heroku DATABASE_URL Link"  
        os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up a randomSecretKey"

* Make sure env.py is in your gitignore file
* Go to heroku and add your secret key value to the config vars under SECRET_KEY

Set up environment 
    
* In settings.py add:
    
        from pathlib import Path
        import os
        import dj_database_ur

        if os.path.exists("env.py"):
            import env

* Set your secret key to

        SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')

* Set database to postgres

        DATABASES = {
        'default':
        dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}

Run migrations using

    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    python3 manage.py migrate

Connect static files with cloudinary (this may be substituted for another platform such as aws)

* Create/login to cloudinary account and create project for this app
* Copy the cloudinary_url from the dashboard
* Set this in your env.py file

        os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] ="cloudinary://1234:SHDUtZi@dbhyi45mc"


* Add this link to the heroku config vars
* Create DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC config var and set to 1


* In settings.py add cloudinary to installed apps under staticfiles
* Set cloudinary as the location for static files

    STATIC_URL = '/static/'
    STATICFILES_STORAGE ='cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
    MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage

* Link templates directory in heroku to app (still in settings.py)

    Place under the BASE_DIR line  

        TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')  

    Place in templates array  

        'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]  

* Add heroku and local environment as allowed hosts

    ALLOWED_HOSTS =["PROJECT_NAME.herokuapp.com", "localhost"]

Create Procfile in root directory **Note the capital P** 

    web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi

Commit and push your changes and your app should run in heroku  
To return to local development just switch debug to true and collectstatic (in heroku config vars) to 0  
Remember to swap the settings back before pushing and returning to deployed version  


## Acknowledgements

I would like to send an amazing thank you to my entire cohort, without your advice and support I wouldn't have made it through this project.  
To Kasia, my cohort tutor, words can't express how much your help, guidance and encouragement has motivated me day after day to keep going through this project and the course in general. Thank you for all that you do for us.  
To my mentor Maria, thank you for being so supportive and encouraging throughout this project, even though you have less availability. It is hugely appreciated.  
Finally to my friends and family subjected to my complaints, raves about mini problems solved, and then forced to test my site at every stage along the way, thank you. For everything. And I'm sorry for boring you with incessant coding rants and raves... At least that's another project out of the way so you get a break for a little while!
